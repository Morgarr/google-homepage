Keeping a log of this project as I work on it. I'll be notating what I have trouble with, so that I can review them in the future.
Having trouble with positioning the navigation links apart from eachother, and changing the color of the link text.
Having difficulty adding a :hover effect to the search bar, not necessary though.
Managed to get the hover effect on the buttons!
The bottom navigation bar is going to be the death of me.
I FIGURED OUT THE BOTTOM NAV BAR FUCKING FINALLY.
Maybe it wasn't *quite* right, but I managed to do a split bottom nav bar, I just had to remember to fix .botleft and .botright to each have a width of 50% instead of 100%, then set them to bottom/left:0 and bottom/right:0.
